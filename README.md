theme-mediaelement
=====================

Base stylesheet for theme developers to work with the WordPress media player (mediaelement.js).

=== Goal ===

Give theme authors an easy way to overwrite the WordPress mediaelement styles (3.6+ audio/video player).

=== Development ===

Follow the "/dev" branch for the latest updates.  Please make pull requests and patches against that branch rather than the master branch.

=== Todo ===

* Figure out elements that I don't understand yet. :)
* Remove as much "style" as possible, including fonts, colors, and backgrounds.
* Don't rely on any images.  Allow theme devs to handle this.
* Simplify.  Simplify.  Simplify.
